Collection of Programms using different Finite-Element Libraries to solve partial differential equations.
The used libraries include 
- deal.ii
- Netgen/NGSolve
- MFEM
The programms build the bases to solve PDEs using an adaptive mesh refinement loop (and in some cases hp-adaptive elements).

The programms are written as the main work of my Bachelor Thesis at Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuernberg. The german title of teh thesis is "Adaptive LÃ¶sung partieller Differentialgleichungen mit verschiedenen Finite-Elemente Bibliotheken".
