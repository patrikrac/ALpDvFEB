Collection of Programms using different Finite-Element Libraries to solve partial differential equations. 

The programms are implemented as part of my bachelor thesis at Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuernberg with the title `"Adaptive solution of partial differential equations using different Finite-Element libraries"` (German: `"Adaptive LÃ¶sung partieller Differnzialgleichungen mit verschiedenen Finite-Elemente Bibliotheken"`)

The libraries used include:
- deal.ii
  - For more information and installation instructions visit <https://www.dealii.org> or view the programm specific README
- Netgen/NGSolve
  - For more information and installation instructions visit <https://ngsolve.org> or view the programm specific README
- MFEM
  - For more information and installation instructions visit <https://mfem.org> or view the programm specific README

The programms build the bases to solve PDEs using an adaptive mesh refinement loop (and in some cases optional hp-adaptive elements).

There is also a parallel branch of the project, where one can find MPI-parallel implementations of each version.  
Additionally, there is a multigrid branch of the project which tries to leverage the capabilities of multigrid methods for performance benefits.

All programms output their cycle-wise soulution as vtk-files which can be visualised by any compatiable tool (I personally recommend [Visit](https://visit-dav.github.io/visit-website/index.html)).

Additionally the programms output multilple custom txt files containing the calculated exact errors of the run. Those are then visualised by a python-script using plotly and matplotlib.
